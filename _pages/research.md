Broadly, I'm interested in problems in gravity and high energy theory. In October 2023, I began a PhD at the University of Sheffield with [Sam Dolan](https://sam-dolan.sites.sheffield.ac.uk) where I'm working on self force theory and fields in curved spacetime. I am also interested in the relationship between quantum field theories and gravity theories and the implications for cosmology. 

Previously, as a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, I worked on thermodynamic aspects of scalar-tensor gravity, using the fluid/gravity correspondence. The idea is to try to build a dictionary between the two subjects to see how fluid thermodynamics can help us effectively interpret different descriptions of gravity sometimes even as an emergent phenomenon. 

I am also interested in quantum entanglement and how this might affect earlier notions of spacetime. This was one of the motivations to study the differences in quantum entanglement between gravitons in de Sitter spacetime and in Minkowski spacetime. <I am also interested in answering these questions through holographic methods in the future and seeing whether cosmology can help us test some of these hypotheses.>  

For my master's [thesis](https://abhinovenagarajans.github.io/files/M.Sc.-Thesis-Abhinove.pdf) I worked on superradiance in a quantum corrected black hole model. 

In the past, I have also worked on a few aspects of statistical mechanics and complex systems. I find the universality of statistical mechanics fascinating. My projects have included trying to understand the neural network of the Macaque monkey through the Ising model, or looking at riffle shuffles that casinos use through the mathematical machinery of Markov chains. I also find the computational aspect of statistical mechanics (and physics in general) quite engaging. 

My publications are available on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2094576).
