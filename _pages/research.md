Broadly, I'm interested in problems in gravity and high energy theory. Specifically, I want to explore problems in QFT in curved spacetime, holography, cosmology, and the relationship between quantum field theories and gravity theories.

Currently, I'm working on thermodynamic aspects of scalar-tensor gravity, using the fluid/gravity correspondence. The idea is to try to build a dictionary between the two subjects to see how fluid dynamics can help us effectively interpret two different descriptions of scalar-tensor gravity. 

I would also like to understand quantum mechanical aspects of gravity; how quantum entanglement or superposition affects the notion of spacetime. This was one of the motivations to study the differences in quantum entanglement between gravitons in de Sitter spacetime and in Minkowski spacetime. I am also interested in answering these questions through holographic methods in the future and seeing whether cosmology can help us test some of these hypotheses.  

For my master's [thesis](https://abhinovenagarajans.github.io/files/M.Sc.-Thesis-Abhinove.pdf) I worked on superradiance in a quantum corrected black hole model. 

Previously, I have also worked on a few aspects of statistical mechanics and complex systems. I find the universality of statistical mechanics quite fascinating. My projects have included trying to understand the neural network of the Macaque monkey through the Ising model, or looking at riffle shuffles that casinos use through the mathematical machinery of Markov chains. I also find the computational aspect of statistical mechanics (and physics in general) quite engaging. 

My publications are available on the Publications tab and on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2094576).
