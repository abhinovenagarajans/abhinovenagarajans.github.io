Outside of physics, I'm interested in music. I learnt Carnatic music as a kid, and I play the guitar. In a previous life, I used to run a small music [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@abhinovenagarajanmusic80). I liked to read as much as I can, although my reading list grows at a rate far higher than my ability to get through the list. Currently, I am (very slowly) reading The Anthropocene Reviewed, by John Green. 

I also like fountain pens and stationery.
