Hi!
I'm Abhinove, a PhD student in [CRAG](https://gravity-cosmology.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) research group at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sheffield.
I intend to use this site to talk about my research interests, and discuss some of the things I'm learning and store notes/problems. Occassionally I might discuss a few of my other interests.   

Welcome to my webpage!
